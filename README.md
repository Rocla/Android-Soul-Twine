# Soul Twine

Create an android Soul on your smartphone. Model it and teach it by interacting with it. Fly out your android soul into a real android such as Nao. Watch the soul possessing the body and taking life. Continue to interact with it. Cut the twine and force your soul to come back into your smartphone.

## At the moment:

The project is developed for Android OS with Android Studio & NAOqi with Nao.

## Current version: 0.0.0
